    <h1>Help with Lunar's terminal</h1>
    <p>When starting out in Lunar, you will probably notice the terminal.</p>
    <p>When you see it, you probably want to know what it can do.</p>
    <p>I, when designing it, just put in a lot of random commands to help with development.</p>
    <p>Such as ~l wHTML (Load HTML from URL input) which would then ask for a URL.</p>
    <p>Then it would load the code for that website.</p>
